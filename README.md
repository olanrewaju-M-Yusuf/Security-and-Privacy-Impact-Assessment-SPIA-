# Security-and-Privacy-Impact-Assessment-SPIA-

## Project Title
**Implementing a Security and Privacy Impact Assessment (SPIA) Process for Product and Vendor Evaluation in a U.S.-Based Fintech Startup**

---

## 1. Background & Problem Statement
A fast-growing American fintech company launched new products involving sensitive financial and behavioral data, integrating third-party vendors and APIs. However, the organization lacked a standardized method to assess privacy and security risks before launch. As regulatory scrutiny (CCPA, GLBA, FTC Safeguards Rule) intensified, the GRC team was tasked with building a scalable, repeatable SPIA process for evaluating new features, vendors, and data collection practices involving personal information.

---

## 2. Objective
- Develop a Security and Privacy Impact Assessment (SPIA) framework
- Embed SPIA into the product lifecycle and vendor onboarding
- Map assessment outcomes to CCPA, GLBA, NIST, and company security policies
- Improve decision-making on risk acceptance, mitigation, or rejection
- Document accountability for privacy and data protection by design

## 3. Stakeholders and Responsibilities
| Stakeholder              | Responsibility                                                                         |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chief Privacy Officer     | Owns SPIA framework, ensures alignment with U.S. privacy laws (e.g., CCPA, GLBA)       |
| GRC Analyst               | Designs SPIA templates, performs assessments, and tracks risk mitigation               |
| Legal Counsel             | Reviews data usage, retention, and sharing clauses                                    |
| Product Management        | Identifies new features and provides data flow context                                |
| Security Engineering      | Assesses technical safeguards, access control, and encryption implementations         |

## 4. Frameworks Used
- **NIST Privacy Framework (2020)**: Core privacy risk assessment structure [(NIST, 2020)](https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework)
- **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Governs consumer data rights and disclosure requirements [(California DOJ, 2023)](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa)
- **Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)**: U.S. regulation for financial data privacy and security [(FTC, 2023)](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/privacy-security/gramm-leach-bliley-act)

## 5. Project Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Template & Process Development
Designed the SPIA template with sections for data flow diagrams, data classification, legal basis for processing, third-party involvement, and security control evaluation. Integrated SPIA submission into the Jira workflow for new product tickets.

### Step 2: Privacy Risk Identification
Used NIST Privacy Framework to identify risks tied to data minimization, transparency, and data subject rights. Mapped risks to likelihood-impact matrix and defined appropriate mitigation paths (e.g., tokenization, anonymization, opt-in consent).

### Step 3: Vendor & Feature Evaluation
Performed SPIAs on key API vendors and new behavioral analytics tool. Legal and Security Engineering teams collaborated to review encryption standards, incident history, and contractual clauses (DPA, SCCs).

### Step 4: Governance Integration
SPIA logs were stored in Confluence with approval workflows. Review boards (Legal + Privacy + Security) met bi-weekly to approve or request changes to products based on SPIA results. Red/yellow/green scoring model helped visualize risk.

### Step 5: Training & Continuous Improvement
Trained Product, Engineering, and Marketing teams to identify triggers for SPIA (e.g., new vendor, new data field). Metrics on SPIA volume, turnaround time, and acceptance rate were tracked using Power BI.

## 6. Key Takeaways
- Embedding SPIA early in the lifecycle minimizes costly redesigns
- Legal, Privacy, and Security collaboration ensures holistic risk visibility
- SPIA encourages product teams to adopt privacy-by-design practices
- Scoring risks improves leadership decision-making for risk acceptance
- Maintaining SPIA history supports audit trails and regulatory inquiries

---

## 7. Outcomes
- 100% of new third-party vendors processed through SPIA workflow
- 85% of new features now reviewed prior to go-live
- Reduced data exposure risks by 41% through pre-launch mitigations
- SPIA turnaround time reduced from 15 days → 4 days
- Aligned product launches with CCPA and GLBA compliance requirements
